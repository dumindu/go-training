// We can use channels to synchronize execution across goroutines.
// Here’s an example of using a blocking receive to wait for a goroutine to finish.

// This is the function we’ll run in a goroutine.
// The done channel will be used to notify another goroutine that this function’s work is done.
func worker(done chan bool) {

	fmt.Print("Working...")
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Done.")

	// Send a value to notify that we’re done.
	done <- true

// ChannelSync Example in golang.
func ChannelSync() {

	// Start a worker goroutine, giving it the channel to notify on.
	done := make(chan bool, 1)
	go worker(done)

	// Block until we receive a notification from the worker on the channel.
	<-done

	// If you removed the <- done line from this program,
	// the program would exit before the worker even started.
