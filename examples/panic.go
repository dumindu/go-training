A panic typically means something went unexpectedly wrong.
Mostly we use it to fail fast on errors that shouldn’t occur during normal operation,
or that we aren’t prepared to handle gracefully.

// Panic func to illustrate panic in go.
func Panic() {
	// A common use of panic is to abort if a function returns
	// an error value that we don’t know how to (or want to) handle.
	// Here’s an example of panicking if we get an unexpected error when creating a new file.

	_, err := os.Create("/tmp/file")
	if err != nil {
